DropPod for Wordpress
=====================

From the comments:

> Quickly upload arbitrary files to an unmanaged directory, otherwise uncontrolled by WordPress. Simple wrapper around Dropzone.js. Includes delete functionality. Part of the Interest Compound support structure, which is why it says 'contact Sam' anytime something is broken. Outside of the Interest Compound, there's no implied support, but you're free to contact me anyway.


Not included in the Wordpress plugin repo because I don't know that they'd like something mostly designed to subvert WP.  Also, lazy.  Parts I wrote are GPL3, I guess.

Uses [dropzone.js](http://www.dropzonejs.com/) and parts of [Plugin Update Checker](https://github.com/YahnisElsts/plugin-update-checker).

Usage documentaion (for people in my podcast network) is available [here](http://vis.nu/droppod).
